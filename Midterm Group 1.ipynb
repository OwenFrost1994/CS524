    "\n",
    "The Martian colonies have to produce their own storage containers for their daily provisions. The production factory makes three types of temperature-resistant tanks: water storage (W), perishable food storage (P), and nonperishable food storage (N). Any colonist can purchase the tanks for personal use. Un-purchased tanks can be re-purposed for general use. The maximum demand this quarter for tanks of type $i$ is estimated to be $d_i$. Tanks of type $i$ can be sold for $p_i$ colony credits per tank. It costs $c_i$ to repurpose a tank of type $i$, but the repurposed tanks can be sold to the government for $C$ credits per tank (independent of the original type of tank). Each tank requires a certain amount of time to produce it, $a_i$ hours per tank for $i \\in \\{W,P,N\\}$. Each tank requires $b_i$ ($i\\in\\{W,P,N\\}$) tons of plasteel alloy to be produced. There are $B$ tons of plasteel alloy and $A$ hours available this quarter.\n",
