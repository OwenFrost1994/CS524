    "## Since we have demand for each cost, the demand vector can be directly built. Then, we know that we can increase or decrease the production in each month with special stuff, where the increase and decrease action can be recorded by the variables. Next, we also know that the storage will add extra cost, which means the storage in each month must be recorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Then according to the problem we have, we need to reduce the cost in production, storage and demand not satisfied. All these values are set to be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two sets of independent variables are used: increase of production in each month and decrease of production in each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## With these two sets of independent variables, the production in each month can be determined: $$p[t] = p[t-1] + incre[t] - decre[t]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Then the storage in each month(assumed to be >=0), can be calculatedas:$$stor[t] = stor[t-1] + p[t] - d[t]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Also the $stor[6]>=2$ is a required condition. In the last month, the storage is the stroage in last month plus the production in this month minus the unsatisfied demand before minus the demand in Dec. When the right side is smaller than 0, the stor[t] is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarly, the demand not satisfied can also be calcualted: $$inshort[t] == d[t] - stor[t-1] - p[t]$$ where the right side is smaller than 0, meaning the demand in this month is totally satisfied, the unsatisfied will automatically be set as 0. Also, the demand not satisfied in last month should be 0, in which we can have extra storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Because the demand unsatisfied before should all be satisfied in Dec, we will have another constrain:$$sum(stor[5] + p[6] - inshort[1:5]) - d[6] >= 2)$$ meaning we will have all demand satisfied at the end of the year and at least 2 ton storage will be left.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Another thing we need to remember is the storage cost. We see that the function of cost toward storage is a staged function. Here to realize the optimization we change it into following form:$$storc[t] == 60 + 75*stor[t]$$ where the cost function becomes convex one. In  this way optimize will trend to reduce the amount of storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally the objective is minimize:$$240*sum(incre) + 210*sum(decre) + sum(storc) + 80*sum(inshort)$$ "
